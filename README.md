# social-network-api

## Description

- I wanted to create an social network api application that would allow me to test API routes using models and controllers for Users, Thoughts, and Reactions. This was a great exercise for practicing writing models and routes using MongoDB. Unfortunately, I have run out of time to get the application fully functional and at the moment, even though my server will start, the routes aren't working in Insomnia. As a result, there's no walkthrough video to demonstrate the functionality. When I'm able to spend more time working on this, I hope to get the application up and running. 

## Usage
